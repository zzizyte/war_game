# Simple card game named "war"

#Description
#Two players typically play the game using a standard playing card deck.
#Card value - two is the lowest and ace is the highest value.

#The deck is divided evenly among the players. Each player reveals the top card of their deck. The player with the higher card takes both cards played and moves them to the bottom of their deck. 
#If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war": both players place the next card face down and another card face up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards #are equal, repeat the "war" instructions.
